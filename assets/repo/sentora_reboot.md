**[Sentora](https://www.sentora.org/)** is a open-source web hosting control panel, which I host in my homelab environment. \
I use it to prototype applications or other services that require a web environment.

I created the **[Reboot Theme](https://github.com/mhoek2/sentora-core/releases)** for Sentora 2.0 to match it with other services in my homelab.

Optional **.SVG** icon support is added to sentora-core.
