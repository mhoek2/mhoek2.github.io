[Sentora](https://www.sentora.org/) is a open-source web hosting control panel, which I host in my homelab environment. \
I use it to prototype applications or other services that require a web environment.

I created this theme for Sentora 2.0 to match it with other environments running in my homelab.
Optional .SVG icon support is added to sentora-core.
