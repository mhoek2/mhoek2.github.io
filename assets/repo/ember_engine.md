This 3D engine is developed using Python, OpenGL and ImGui. \
It demonstrates the core principles of 3D rendering and interactive graphics.

The primary goal of this project was to gain more knowledge in Python programming.

“Because of Python's limitations, it is not typically used for 3D graphics applications. However, I still value it as a good exercise!”

I included **[Github CI](https://github.com/mhoek2/EmberEngine/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)** to build automated documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
