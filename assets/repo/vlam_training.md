REA College works on an E-learning platform intended to extend the use of a handbook for the **[VLAM Training](https://www.hanze.nl/nl/onderzoeken/centers/centre-of-expertise-healthy-ageing/projecten/voorbereid-van-leeromgeving-naar-arbeidsmarkt-vlam)**. 

My role is to provide the fundamentals of the application, **frontend & backend**.\
So it can be extended with more features by other developers/students in the future. 

I translated a Figma design provided by the team to a functional web interface. \
I designed the database and admin panel, allowing to manage all aspects of the training content and user progress. \
The application is built with CodeIgniter4 with CI Shield at its core.

I included **[Github CI](https://github.com/mhoek2/EmberEngine/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)** to build automated 
documentation using [phpDocumentor](https://phpdoc.org/), [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/) and [PhpMetrics](https://phpmetrics.org/). 
It also runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) static code analyzers, converting JSON to .rst, generating report pages in the documentation directly.
