REA College requested an E-learning platform that extend the use of the handbook for the **VLAM Training**. \
The application is built on top of CodeIgniter4 with CI Shield.

The front-end allows candidate to work on cases and answer related questions in assignments. 
This builds a personal dashboard showing their progress.

Also, a admin panel is built for administrators. 
They can create the assignments and cases for the training.

My role is to provide the fundamentals of the application, so it can be extended with more features by other developers in the future.

I included **[Github CI](https://github.com/mhoek2/EmberEngine/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)** to build automated 
documentation using [phpDocumentor](https://phpdoc.org/), [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/) and [PhpMetrics](https://phpmetrics.org/). 
It also runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) static code analyzers, converting JSON to .rst, generating report pages in the documentation directly.
